# 🎪 Wheel of Town

*"Welcome to Wheel of Town! Pat Roy and Vanna Roy got the puzzles, the prizes, and the occasional bankruptcy. Let’s spin!*

---

A browser-based word puzzle game where you face off against two opponents. Built with React and three.js, featuring a 3D wheel, letter board, and just enough chaos to keep things interesting.

## 🎮 What’s the Deal?

Spin the wheel, guess letters, buy vowels, and solve the puzzle before an opponent beats you to it.
The wheel might be kind, it might be cruel.

**Highlights:**
• 3D spinning wheel with satisfying physics
• Two AI opponents with distinct strategies
• Hosted by Pat and Vanna Roy
• Playable with keyboard or mouse
• Accessibility features so everyone gets a fair shot

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd wheel-of-town
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `localhost:5173` in your browser and start spinning.

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Spin the wheel
2. Guess consonants to earn cash
3. Buy vowels for \$250
4. Solve the puzzle to win the round
5. Try not to go bankrupt before the opponents do

The cautious AI plays it safe. The aggressive AI doesn’t.

## 🎪 The Town Roster

**Pat Roy** – Loves a good pun, keeps the game moving, probably owns too many blazers
**Vanna Roy** – Effortlessly reveals letters and has never missed a cue
**AI Cautious** – Patient, careful, and annoyingly consistent
**AI Aggressive** – Swings for the fences every time

## 🧪 Testing

npm run test:e2e
npx playwright test tests/spin-and-zoom.spec.js
