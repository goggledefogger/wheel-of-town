# 🎪 Wheel of Town

*"Welcome to Wheel of Town! Pat Roy and Vanna Roy bring the puzzles, the prizes, and the occasional bankruptcy. Let's spin!*

---

A browser-based word puzzle game where you face off against two opponents. Built with React and three.js, featuring a 3D wheel, letter board, and just enough chaos to keep things interesting.

## 🎮 What's the Deal?

Spin the wheel, guess letters, buy vowels, and solve the puzzle before an opponent beats you to it.
The wheel might be kind, it might be cruel.

**Highlights:**
• 3D spinning wheel with satisfying physics and harmonious color palette
• Confetti and celebratory effects for round/game win
• Accessibility and keyboard navigation


## 🎯 How to Play

1. Spin the wheel
2. Guess consonants to earn cash
3. Buy vowels for \$250
4. Solve the puzzle to win the round
5. Try not to go bankrupt before the opponents do

Tiny Roy plays it safe. Big Roy doesn’t.

## 🎪 The Town Roster

**Pat Roy** – Loves a good pun, keeps the game moving, probably owns too many blazers

**Vanna Roy** – Effortlessly reveals letters and has never missed a cue

**Opponent: Tiny Roy** – Patient, careful, and annoyingly consistent

**Opponent: Big Roy** – Swings for the fences every time

**You: You** - What's your strategy, and why is it so bad?
